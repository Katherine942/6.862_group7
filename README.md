# CNN Supervised Learning Method for Artifacts and Noise Removal in MRI
6.862 Group7 Project; Team Members: Katherine Li & Ngoc La & Tommy Shi
## Description
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with its non-invasive characteristics is a promising method to study human organs and for disease diagnosis and staging. However, MR images usually come with noises, which are from random noise and artifacts, subject motion including respiration, cardiac motion and peristalsis of gastrointestinal tracts. In this project, we aim to apply supervised learning methods to learn from training data, which is generated by adding synthetic random noise (Rician noise) into post-processed MR images, and test on various generic MR images.

The actual implementation codes for the project can be found in folder src/denoise_cnn
